I've read in a book on a lost night
That suffering helps a heart to ripen
If that is true, it must be summertime
And I am a peach on the ground

'Cause oh I have lost, and I haven't found
One good way to live here without you
But pain is just love with nowhere to go
And there's always room for love, I know

I don't know what stage of grief
I am singing on these days
But I know there is something new in me
Like someone came and switched on a light

Oh, I have lost but oh, I have found
Parts of you I never knew I carried
And pain is just love with nowhere to go
And there's always room for love, I know

Hitting my head against the wall
That's what it's like when I want to call you
So many questions, big and small
And you will forever hold the key

But I know I get one wild and precious life
I read it in the poems I treat as scripture
So, I'll carry 'round this heart
Bruised and ripe
And I will keep on falling to the ground
